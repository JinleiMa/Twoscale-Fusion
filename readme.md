********************************************************************************************************************************
Usage:

There are two demo files:

(1) Script_BoostedRandomWalk.m

Script_BoostedRandomWalk.m aims to implement the image fusion using boosted random walk,

corresponding to Section 2.3 Boosting of random walks-based algorithm of the paper.

Note that before running 'Script_BoostedRandomWalk.m', you need to run 'compile.m'.

(2) Script_RandomWalk.m

Script_RandomWalk.m aims to implement the image fusion using random walk,

corresponding to Section 2.2 Estimation using random walks of the paper.
